# Face_Recognization

Face Recognition System
Objective:
To build a Python-based face recognition system using OpenCV and related libraries. It detects and recognizes faces either from images or live video feed.

 Main Components:
Libraries Used:
cv2 (OpenCV) â€“ for image processing and face detection.

os â€“ to handle directories and files.

numpy â€“ for array manipulation.

PIL (Python Imaging Library) â€“ for image handling.

pickle â€“ to serialize and deserialize Python objects.

Steps Implemented:
ðŸ“Œ 1. Collecting Training Data
Images are stored in folders labeled with the person's name.

Each person's images are collected and labeled.

ðŸ“Œ 2. Face Detection and Feature Extraction
Haar Cascade Classifier is used for face detection (haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml).

Detected faces are extracted and stored with corresponding labels.

ðŸ“Œ 3. Training the Recognizer
OpenCV's cv2.face.LBPHFaceRecognizer_create() is used to train the model.

Model and label mappings are saved using pickle and cv2.face.

ðŸ“Œ 4. Face Recognition from Live Feed
The model is loaded and run on live webcam feed.

Detected faces are matched with known labels and displayed with names.

ðŸ“¦ Outputs:
A trained model (trainer.yml).

A labels dictionary (labels.pickle).

Live recognition with labeled boxes around recognized faces.

ðŸ“ˆ Potential Improvements:
Add more images per person to improve accuracy.

Use a deep learning-based recognizer like FaceNet or Dlib for higher accuracy.

Add GUI for easier interaction.
